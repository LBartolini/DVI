        <h3>Energy Management System (EMS)</h3>
        <p>At the core of the EMS is the Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM).</p>
        <p>The SPM is a power generation plant deployed within the Campus DVI @ UniDV. 
            The campus hosts a number of facilities for university students and staff, including a gym and a tennis court. 
            Classrooms, laboratories, and offices are located inside five buildings. 
            Moreover, a sixth building contains the library and some study rooms.</p>
        <p>The SPM has its own <b>Battery</b> that is used for providing electricity to the whole campus.
            The battery is recharged via <b>Solar Panels</b> and, in case of high demand, by a <b>Gas Generator</b>.</p>
        <p>The whole system is controlled by a <b>BPMN</b> service. Also a <b>SCADA</b> server is used to manage all the field devices and start/stop the generator.</p>
